# Last night’s CivicTechWR Showcase was packed with people, energy, and purpose.

Thank you to everyone who came out, asked questions, shared ideas, and helped make it all happen. 💡 💬

Big thanks to our presenters from **Project Ploughshares, PECH, and One Million Neighbours** for showing what civic tech looks like when it meets real community needs. And to our volunteers who handled setup, food, doors, cleanup, and more. 

## You made the night run smoothly from start to finish 🙌 🍕

We’re taking a short break next week.
No meetup on Wednesday, September 17.

We’ll be back on Wednesday, September 24 at 6:00 PM at Builders Club for our regular hack night 🛠️

Looking forward to seeing you then! 💙
